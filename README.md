# Pong

This will be a pong game using SFML to handle windowing, events, graphics, and audio. To be clear, I didn't write SFML, nor did I alter it. I'm also using NotoSansMono for the font

## Gameplay

two players each have a bar which acts as their paddle, and a ball in the middle. The ball bounces off of the paddle and if the ball gets past your paddle, the other side gets a point. The left player uses 'w' and 's' to move up and down, and the right player uses the arrow keys.

## Completed

* Add a ball with physics support.
* Add paddles that accept user input.
* Add a score card.
* Add a menu that can allow players to start a new game, quit, etc.
